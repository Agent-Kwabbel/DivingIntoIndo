# Diving into Indo Website

Hey hey, this is the source code for the website of the trip to Indonesia my friend and I made.

I'm using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the styling.
This is my first time using Next.js, and this is just an experiment, so I don't take this website seriously or something.
I will use this website to document my trip to Indonesia, and I hope that it will be useful for others. ðŸ˜Š

I was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBIjgBVFjVI) to use the whole [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) "workflow" for once.
So there's that disclaimer, and hence the use of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN and Vercel.
All the other technologies are here because I wanted to try the [t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) as my first next.js stack.
