# Diving into Indo Website

Hey hey, this is the source code for the website of my trip to Indonesia.

I'm using Next.js for the frontend and Tailwind CSS for the styling.
This is my first time using Next.js, and this is just a hobby project, so I don't take this website seriously.
I will use this website to document my trip to Indonesia, and I hope that it will be useful for others.

I was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBIjgBVFjVI) to use the whole [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) experience "workflow" for fun.
So that disclaimer. And hence the use of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN and Vercel.
All the other technologies are here because I wanted to try the [t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) as my first next.js stack.
