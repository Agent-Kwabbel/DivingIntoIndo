# Diving into Indo Website

Hey hey, this is the source code for the website of the trip to Indonesia my friend and I made.

I'm using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the styling.
I will use this website to document my trip to Indonesia, and host it later some with some other data for display purposes.

I was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBIjgBVFjVI) to use the whole [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) "workflow" for once.
So there's that disclaimer, and hence the use of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN and Vercel. I basically used it for some large boring front-end design tasks, and it worked really well.
All the other technologies are here because I wanted to try the [t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) as my first next.js stack.

*The website is currently statically hosted with some AI generated placeholder content for display purposes.*
